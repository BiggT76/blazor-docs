#observable-data-intro
Databound components can benefit from live data - when the data source collection changes, the components should update to reflect that change. Most data-bound components in the Telerik UI for Blazor suite implement such functionality.

When the `Data` of the component is a collection that implements the `INotifyCollectionChanged` interface (such as `ObservableCollection`), the Telerik components subscribe to its `CollectionChanged` event to update. This means that adding items, removing items, or clearing the collection updates the components (its `.Add()`, `.Remove()` and `.Clear()` methods).
